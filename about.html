            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <h3>Founder</h3>
            <img src="image/woman watch.png" alt image="image" height="250px" width="400px">
            <h4>Carolina Christ</h4>
            <p>She has spent the last 20 years working for luxury watch publications in sales and marketing. She has
                worked for Europa Star,Revolution, Elite Traveler, Quintessentially and The Rake. She loves wearing
                men's timepieces and since she
                started WristWorthy has a list as long as your arm of new watches she would love to buy.</p>
        </center>
        <h3>The Idea</h3>
        <p>The idea for WristWorthy came about because people often asked us for advice about which watch they should
            buy.
            The more this happened—and it happened a lot—the more we realized that searching for a watch online is a
            minefield
            of information. Leveraging our 20 years of experience working in the watch industry, we understood the
            intricacies
            and nuances of selecting the perfect watch.</p>
        <p>The individual brand websites are great, but there are hundreds of watch brands in Switzerland alone, so
            checking
            out each page individually would take you weeks, and that's if you know the names of all the brands.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>The WristWorthy Shop</h3>
        <p>The WristWorthy Shop features a selection of watches handpicked by our team and sourced directly from the
            manufacturer, so 100% genuine. We are continuously adding new brands and models to our shop collection. We
            are
            passionate about delivering exceptional service and great value to our customers, and we are an authorized
            retailer
            of all the brands we sell.</p>
